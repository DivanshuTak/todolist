# todolist

Somtimes it is to hard to know what to do today we were always analyzing that I have this work to do but I do not have a time to this work. 

So  After analyzing some of situation of my daily routine I make the list of the work done by me in a whole day.

Then after optimizing all the things I conclude that will make list of all the work which I have to done in a whole day.

So after that I start creating todolist app to keep track on all my activities. The TodoList is a very small project which will contain the  list all my morning to night schedule. 

In this app you just have to type in your daliy tasks which you want to do and store them.

In this app you can manage your tasks of whole Year, Month, Week and Day. And at the last of your sprint you have the with lists of tasks and due dates what you have to do.
